# MatrixInterpreter
A command line program that will ultimately be able to perform matrix and scalar algebra and basic matrix operations.

**Current State:**

Right now scalar algebra is possible, and you can create matrices but not do anything with them.

**Example Code:**
```
a = (5+3)*2^4
b = 2*3
c = a+b
```
You can see the result of any of these operations by typing the name of the scalar.

Or, to make a simple matrix:
```
A = inp()
B = id(4,4)
```
Again, the results can be seen by simply typing the name of the matrix.
