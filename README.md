# MatrixInterpreter
A command line program that can perform matrix and scalar algebra and basic matrix operations.

**Current State:**

Right now scalar and matrix algebra is possible, and boolean expressions can be evaluated.

**Example Code:**
```
>>> a = (5+3)*2^4
>>> b = 2*3
>>> c = a+b
>>> prn(c)
```
You can see the result of any of these operations by typing the name of the scalar.

Or, to make a simple matrix:
```
>>> A = 
[1 2
[3 4
>>> B = id(4,4)
>> C =
[5 6
[7 8
>>> A*B
>>> A*C
```
Again, the results can be seen by simply typing the name of the matrix.
